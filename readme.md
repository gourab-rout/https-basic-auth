# HTTPS Service with Basic Authorization

To build a https service in mule we need the following steps.

## Requirement
   1. Generating a self signed certificate
   2. HTTPS Listener with TLS Configuration
   3. Configuring Spring Authentication Manager for basic auth username and password
   
## Generating Certificate

   Generate a keystore if you donâ€™t have one already.
   The below command creates a file named keystore.jks. Before proceeding, verify that this file exists and appears in the folder    src/main/resources.

```
keytool -genkeypair -keystore keystore.jks   -dname "CN=localhost, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown"  
-keypass password  -storepass password  -keyalg RSA  -sigalg SHA1withRSA  -keysize 2048  -alias mule  -ext SAN=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1 -validity 9999
```

## HTTPS Listener with TLS Configuration

   1. Keep the jks file under src/main/resources
   2. Configure an HTTPS connector inside your Mule configuration:
